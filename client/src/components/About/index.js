            <h3>About WikiBoots</h3>
            <p>As a baby, I had a hard time understanding life.  Drooling, pooping my pants, and what I should/should not put in my mouth.  My parents would talk, but they may as well have been speaking German.  I often thought "If only there was somebody at a closer level to me.  A toddler perhaps, that has recently gone through what I am going through and could talk to me in a language I could understand.  Baby talk, if you will..."</p>
            <p>At that point, my life had a purpose, and WikiBoots was born.</p>
